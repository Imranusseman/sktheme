                <p class="text text-b2"><p>Hi everyone, sorry for being inactive in this regard. The religion related projects are now ALLOWED.</p>
<p>Q.Why it was not allowed before?</p>
<ul>
<li>We received alot of reports that includes misleading messages and comments between two communities</li>
<li>Risks of personal attacks to the team upon unpublishing such projects because of other reasons.</li>
<li>Some people may feel being dominant and may tend to upload something inappropriate to create conflicts.</li>
<li>Some people were using ISI logos and it was getting reported saying its terrorism logo. It really confused what to do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it is now allowed?</p>
<ul>
<li>We were not expecting reactive and negative feedback from some users, they started to claim us as racist and created campaigns to uninstall the app among their communities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disclaimer:- We have attached a screenshot for those people who have spread false news about Sketchub being racist to muslims brotherhood (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/NLrhH1r.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/NLrhH1r.jpg</a>)</p>
<p>Again, we are not against any particular community as per claimed by some individuals. It was just an unsuccessful approach to suppress racism. Sorry for the inconveniences</p>
<p>Visit <a href="https://sketchub.in/user_policy">https://sketchub.in/user_policy</a> for reading more rules.</p></p>

                <img class="news-card__img" src="">
                <p class="text text-b2"><p>We've been receiving a lot of reports lately. We get every single on, so don't try to spam reporting, as that may only result in a ban.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are submitting a copyright report, please include enough information to prove your point, not just &quot;stole my project&quot;. We are all volunteers, and will not got out of our way if you don't give us enough information. Try to include with your report: Enough information, proof you own the project, and your email (or you can reply the the automatic email sent when you report a project. All admins have access to that email). </li>
<li>If you find a project with invalid title, description, icon, or screenshots: We try our best to enforce the rules, however with the amount of projects being uploaded and that, once again, we are all volunteers, we may miss some violations. We'll try to investigate these reports, however they aren't our highest priority.</li>
<li>Comments: We try to moderate comments, but we don't have a comment feed, so we have to go into each project and check each comment. Needless to say, with the amount of projects being uploaded, we can't check every comment. If someone comments something and it's breaking the T&amp;C, feel free to report it and we'll get to it as soon as we can. Cursing and threats are never allowed on Sketchub.
And once again, at this time, projects made using Sketchware mods are still NOT allowed on Sketchub, we are preparing to make it available.</li>
